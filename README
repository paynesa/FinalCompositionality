Columns are (tab separated):
average human score (out of 5), syntax category, phrase, paraphrase, list of 5 individual human scores

ppdb-sample.tsv: judgements on paraphrase pairs that were sampled uniformly from the syntactic categories in PPDB and stratified over different ranges of the paraphrase probability score p(e1|e2). (Described in Section 2 of the paper, in the "Supervised scoring model" paragraph.)

wiki-sample: judgements on full list of paraphrases for 100 phrases chosen at random from Wikipedia. (Described in Section 2.1 of the paper, in the "Goodness of the top-ranked paraphrases" paragraph.)
